# Cities

Cities are used to produce resources, create troups and build buildings.

Each player will get automatically one city when he enter the game first time. The location for the city will be picted based on an algorithmus see [creation](#creation)  

In the city view the player can see different spots where he can create buildings. 

He can only select buildings which a suited for the place and if he has the requirements to build the bilding. Requirements in terms of Techtree.

Each Building is clickable so you can enter the building view to manage the building.
